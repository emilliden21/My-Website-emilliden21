            <h2>Art History</h2>
            <h3>I first became fascinated with art and art museums in high school when I took my first art history class.</h3>
            <h3>My favorite art history class at Dartmouth has been Italian Renaissance Architecture with Nicola Camerlenghi.</h3>
            <h3>Currently, I work with Professor Camerlenghi on "Augmented Dartmouth:" an augmented reality app that allows users
                to scan works of art around Dartmouth's campus. 
            </h3>

            <h2>Travelling</h2>
            <h3>Some cool places I have visited recently include Mexico, Chile, and Argentina!</h3>
