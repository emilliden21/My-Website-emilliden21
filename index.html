            <h2>Art History</h2>
            <h1>I first became fascinated with art and art museums in high school when I took my first art history class.</h1>
            <h1>My favorite art history class at Dartmouth has been Italian Renaissance Architecture with Nicola Camerlenghi.</h1>
            <h1>Currently, I work with Professor Camerlenghi on "Augmented Dartmouth:" an augmented reality app that allows users
                to scan works of art around Dartmouth's campus.

            <h2>Travelling</h2>
